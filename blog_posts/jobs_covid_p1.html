    <h1> How I Secured Employement During Covid  </h1>

        What a wild year it's been. The illustrious year of 2020 threw everything but the kitchen sink at us. 
        Almost everyone has dealt with the large-scale effects of this pandemic, from a destroyed economy to a 
        prolonged period of social isolation. Additionally, we've all dealt with our own pandemic-induced personal 
        problems, ranging from the premature passing of loved ones, to cancelled events and milestones, to serious 
        professional setbacks. As this year draws to a close, I want to reflect on my experiences and share my tips 
        in finding employment during the worst pandemic that my generation will (hopefully) ever see.

        First, a little background around my situation circa COVID. Back in March, I was still taking classes and wrapping 
        up my M.S. in Analytics at NC State. Luckily for me, the curriculum was structured in a way that classes ended right
        around when the statewide lockdowns began. I only had to contend with two days worth of Zoom University. However, most 
        of the employers that come to our program during the March-May timeline to network/interview students as part of our 
        internal process cancelled all plans indefintely, which was a blow to people like me who hadn't yet secured any employment.
        As much as it sucked in the moment, I honestly believed that this whole thing would be over and done with in 2-3 weeks.
        If only.
