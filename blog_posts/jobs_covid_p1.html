    <h1> How I Secured Employement During Covid  </h1>

    <p>
        What a wild year it's been. The illustrious year of 2020 threw everything but the kitchen sink at us. 
        Almost everyone has dealt with the large-scale effects of this pandemic, from a destroyed economy to a 
        prolonged period of social isolation. Additionally, we've all dealt with our own pandemic-induced personal 
        problems, ranging from the premature passing of loved ones, to cancelled events and milestones, to serious 
        professional setbacks. As this year draws to a close, I want to reflect on and share my tips and experiences 
        in finding employment during the worst pandemic that my generation will (hopefully) ever see.
