	<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	<p> I am an aspiring analytics professional looking to share my work with the world. Currently, I am an M.S. candidate at the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. In May 2019, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Music. During my time at UNC, I worked as a research assistant conducting analytics on yeast microscopy image data and polymer chain simulations.</p>

	<p> At the Institute, I have built upon my analytics skill set through a team-based practicum project. Our sponsor, Primrose Schools, gave us real company data to work with. As Technical Lead of the project, I spearheaded the data cleaning and processing infrastructure. Additionally, I took responsibility over the technical deliverables given to Primrose Schools at the end of the project. </p>
	<p> I offer a diverse background combined with a large array of skills. As a biology and music double major, I had quite the interdisciplinary education, with a focus on both analytical thought and creative passion. I am strong in R programming, Python programming, Matlab programming, Jupyter notebook, SQL, and Tableau. I have working knowledge of SAS programming, Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Excel, and HTML. I have a good grasp of the fundamentals of statistical modeling and machine learning. I am always looking to further refine and expand my data science toolkit so that I can better inform people of the stories locked in their data.  </p>
