        I am an analytics professional.<br> 
	    I extract and communicate insights from data <br>
        using various modeling techniques, powerful  <br>
        visualizations, and effective presentation strategies.

    <p>
        In August 2020, I began working for Lowe's Companies as a Data Analyst within the BI & Analytics branch of the Data Analytics
        and Computational Insights division. 
    </p>

	<p> Starting May 2020, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Cape Fear Collective, a non-profit organization based in Wilmington, NC that seeks to use data science to understand the factors that contribute to social inequities afflicting marginalized groups.
        I have been working as part of a team to source, clean, and transform freely available socioeconomic data to create county-level indices. 
        Using these county-level indices, our team is conducting k-means clustering and segmentation analysis to create county-level peer groups, ultimately informing the creation of a regional scorecard. </p> 

	<p> In May 2020, I acquired an M.S. degree in Analytics from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. 
        At the Institute, I built upon my analytics skill set through a team-based practicum project. 
        Our sponsor, Primrose Schools, gave us real company data to work with. 
        As Technical Lead of the project, I spearheaded the data cleaning and processing infrastructure. 
        Additionally, I took responsibility over the technical deliverables given to Primrose Schools at the end of the project. </p>

	<p>In May 2019, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Music. 
       During my time at UNC, I worked as a research assistant self-teaching and conducting analytics on yeast microscopy image data and polymer chain simulations.</p>

	<p> I offer a diverse background in conjunction with a large array of skills. 
        As a biology and music double major, I had quite the interdisciplinary education, with a focus on both analytical thought and creative passion. 
        I am strong in Python, R, MATLAB, Jupyter, SQL, and Tableau. I have working knowledge of Git, SAS, Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Excel, and HTML/CSS. 
        I have a good grasp of statistical modeling and machine learning. 
        I am always looking to further refine and expand my data science toolkit so that I can better inform people of the stories locked in their data.  </p>
