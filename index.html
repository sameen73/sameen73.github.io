	<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	<p> I am an aspiring analytics professional looking to share my work with the world. Currently, I am an M.S. candidate at the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. In May 2019, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Music. During my time at UNC, I worked as a research assistant conducting analytics on yeast microscopy image data and polymer chain simulations.</p>
