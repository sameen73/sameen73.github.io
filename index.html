    	I am an aspiring analytics <br>
        professional actively seeking opportunities.<br> 
	I extract and communicate insights from data <br>
        using various modeling techniques, powerful  <br>
        visualizations, and effective presentation strategies.

	<p> Currently, I work as a Data Science Intern at Cape Fear Collective, a non-profit organization based in Wilmington, NC that seeks to use data science to understand the factors that contribute to social inequities afflicting marginalized groups. I have been working as part of a team to source, clean, and transform freely available socioeconomic data to create county-level indices. Using these county-level indices, our team is conducting k-means clustering and segmentation analysis to create county-level peer groups, ultimately informing the creation of a regional scorecard. </p> 

	<p> In May 2020, I acquired an M.S. degree in Analytics from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. At the Institute, I built upon my analytics skill set through a team-based practicum project. Our sponsor, Primrose Schools, gave us real company data to work with. As Technical Lead of the project, I spearheaded the data cleaning and processing infrastructure. Additionally, I took responsibility over the technical deliverables given to Primrose Schools at the end of the project. </p>

	<p>In May 2019, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Music. During my time at UNC, I worked as a research assistant self-teaching and conducting analytics on yeast microscopy image data and polymer chain simulations.</p>

	<p> I offer a diverse background in conjunction with a large array of skills. As a biology and music double major, I had quite the interdisciplinary education, with a focus on both analytical thought and creative passion. I am strong in Python, R, MATLAB, Jupyter, SQL, and Tableau. I have working knowledge of Git, SAS, Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Excel, and HTML/CSS. I have a good grasp of the fundamentals of statistical modeling and machine learning. I am always looking to further refine and expand my data science toolkit so that I can better inform people of the stories locked in their data.  </p>

	<h4> StockX 2019 Data Challenge </h4>
    <div id = "stockxanalysis" class = "w3-container"> 
    <p>I combined my love for sneakers with my passion for data by analyzing StockX consumer purchases and trying to elucidate the underlying patterns. Using the dataset StockX provided for its 2019 Data Challenge, I conducted an end-to-end analysis comparing two popular brands of sneakers: Yeezys and Off-Whites. I found that Off-Whites are more hype than Yeezys, and that it was possible to predict a "hype index", or how much consumers would pay over retail price for sneakers.

	<h4> Predicting Client Subscription </h4>
    <div id = "clientsub" class = "w3-container">
    <p> I took on an age-old business problem: predicting client subscriptions. I used the publicly available telemarketing subscription dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data is based on real data from a Portuguese banking institution. This project was a great way to try out a variety of models while making informed business assumptions. And while all of the models ended up overfitting the training data, this project was a useful exercise in taking a step back and evaluating the many ways models could be improved in future iterations.

	<h4> Topic Modeling of COVID-19 Research Abstracts </h4>
    <div id = "covid_proj" class = "w3-container">
    <p> COVID-19 has altered life as we know it. As scientists all across the globe continue to study the novel coronavirus, fellow MSA '20 graduate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iqra-munawar-83000683/">Iqra Munawar</a> and I decided to do our part to help resolve this crisis. Using the CORD-19 Research Data Challenge dataset hosted on Kaggle, we implemented NLP techniques and popular language  models to distill the immense volume of research publications down to 5 major topics: public health/epidemiology, cellular mechanisms, medical procedures, testing/symptomatic presentation, and meta-analysis/literature review. This will hopefully help labs locate relevant research without having to go through every single piece of literature out there. Even though this project is a work in progress, I have already augmented my skills in NLP pre-processing, topic modeling, and unsupervised learning. This has also been an excellent opportunity to leverage my biology background. Check out the text pre-processing notebook<a href= "paper_abstract_cleaner.html">here</a>. The modeling notebook can be found <a href= "paper_abstract_modeling.html">here</a>.
