    <p style = "font-size:20px"> Hello, I'm Sameen Salam!
    	I am an aspiring analytics <br>
        professional actively seeking opportunities.<br> 
	I extract and communicate insights from data <br>
        using various modeling techniques, powerful  <br>
        visualizations, and effective presentation strategies.

	<p> In May 2020, I acquired an M.S. degree in Analytics from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. In May 2019, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Music. During my time at UNC, I worked as a research assistant conducting analytics on yeast microscopy image data and polymer chain simulations.</p>

	<p> At the Institute, I built upon my analytics skill set through a team-based practicum project. Our sponsor, Primrose Schools, gave us real company data to work with. As Technical Lead of the project, I spearheaded the data cleaning and processing infrastructure. Additionally, I took responsibility over the technical deliverables given to Primrose Schools at the end of the project. </p>
	<p> I offer a diverse background in conjunction with a large array of skills. As a biology and music double major, I had quite the interdisciplinary education, with a focus on both analytical thought and creative passion. I am strong in Python, R, Matlab, Jupyter notebook, SQL, and Tableau. I have working knowledge of Git, SAS, Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Excel, and HTML. I have a good grasp of the fundamentals of statistical modeling and machine learning. I am always looking to further refine and expand my data science toolkit so that I can better inform people of the stories locked in their data.  </p>
